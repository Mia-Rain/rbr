rbr
-- a room builder for the upcoming mia roguelike
---
Current Status
-- rbr/miarl has been on pause for a long time as the existing drunkard walk style algorithm
-- was really really draining to develop for
-- and the sheer scope of all the libraries neededd eventually got to me
-- however I plan to eventually breathe new life into miarl/rbr
-- soonâ„¢ new libraries will be developed to replace or be integrated into rbr
-- such as a binary space partitioning algorithm via a library
-- and a secondary library for path building within the BSP generated rooms 
---
Algorithm
-- rbr uses a drunkard walk style algorithm for its generation atm
-- it should be noted that this algorithm is extremely slow in it's current form
-- in the future i may attempt new algorithms but this works for now

-- a nerdfonts compatible font should be used

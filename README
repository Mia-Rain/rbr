# rbr
-- a room builder for the upcoming mia roguelike
# caveats
-- generating a ""unique"" room requires some access a PRNG (pseudorandom number generator)
-- building a pure software one would likely be a painful task in pure sh
-- as such this project uses `/dev/urandom` and some self made logic along with an edited LCG algorithm
-- to generate random numbers (see psh-prng)
# notes
-- please clone with `--recursive` as this project depends on the submods to operate

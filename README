rbr
-- a room builder for the upcoming mia roguelike
---
Current Status
-- Abandoned; miarl to become Fragments
-- Which will feature a new custom algorithm
-- using on the fly generation of single chunk rooms
---- Idea originally seen in Dead Estate
---- go play that ;3
---
Algorithm
-- rbr uses a drunkard walk style algorithm for its generation atm
-- it should be noted that this algorithm is extremely slow in it's current form
-- in the future i may attempt new algorithms but this works for now
